    drugbank:description "Famotidine is a competitive histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonist that works to inhibit gastric acid secretion. It is commonly used in gastrointestinal conditions related to acid secretion, such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in adults and children.[L11166] Compared to other H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, famotidine displays high selectivity towards this receptor; in a study consisting of healthy volunteers and patients with acid hypersecretory disease, famotidine was about 20 to 50 times more potent at inhibiting gastric acid secretion than [cimetidine] and eight times more potent than [ranitidine] on a weight basis.[A189462] Famotidine is used in various over-the-counter and off-label uses.[L11166] While oral formulations of famotidine are more commonly used, the intravenous solution of the drug is available for use in hospital settings.[L11142]" ;

    drugbank:indication """Famotidine is indicated in pediatric and adult patients (with the bodyweight of 40 kg and above) for the management of active duodenal ulcer (DU), active gastric ulcer, symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and erosive esophagitis due to GERD, diagnosed by biopsy.[L11139]\r
\r
It is also indicated in adult patients for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasias) and reduction of the risk of DU recurrence.[L11139]\r
\r
The intravenous formulation of famotidine is available for some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers or as an alternative to the oral dosage form for short-term use in patients who are unable to take oral medication.[L11142]\r
\r
Over-the-counter famotidine is used for the management and prevention of heartburn caused by gastroesophageal reflux in children and adults. Off-label uses of famotidine include the reduction of NSAIDs-associated gastrointestinal effects, treatment of refractory urticarial, prevention of stress ulcer in critically-ill patients, and symptomatic relief of gastritis.[L11166,L11172]""" ;
    drugbank:mechanism_of_action "Histamine acts as a local hormone that stimulates the acid output by parietal cells via a paracrine mechanism. Neuroendocrine cells called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells lie close to the parietal cells and regulate the basal secretion of histamine. Histamine release is also promoted from stimulation by acetylcholine and gastrin, a peptide hormone. Gastrin (G) cells release gastrin, which works on CCK<sub>2</sub> receptors on ECL cells. This action promotes the release of histamine from ECL cells. Upon release, histamine acts on H<sub>2</sub> receptors expressed on the basolateral membrane of parietal cells, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activated proton pumps on parietal cells. Proton pump releases more protons into the stomach, thereby increasing the secretion of acid. [T28] In conditions that are associated with acid hypersecretion such as ulcers, there is a loss of regulation of acid secretion. Famotidine works on H<sub>2</sub> receptors and blocks the actions of histamine.[L11166]" ;

Symptoms of overdose resemble the adverse events seen with the use of recommended doses, and they should be responded with supportive and symptomatic treatment. Any unabsorbed drug should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the patient should be monitored accordingly. The use of hemodialysis to eliminate the drug from the systemic circulation is effective, but the experience of using hemodialysis in response to famotidine overdose is limited in clinical settings.[L11139]""" ;

    drugbank:description """Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics.[A39074] The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin.[A39075] Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]\r
\r
On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]""" ;

    drugbank:id "DB01050" ;
    drugbank:indication """Ibuprofen is the most commonly used and prescribed NSAID. It is a very common over-the-counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.[A39096]\r
\r
The use of ibuprofen and its enantiomer [DB09213] in a racemic mix is common for the management of mild to moderate pain related to dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, postoperative dental pain, spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and soft tissue disorder.[A39097]\r
\r
Due to its activity against prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis, ibuprofen has been attributed to alteration of platelet function and prolongation of gestation and labour.[A39092]\r
\r
As ibuprofen is a widely used medication, the main therapeutic indications are:\r
\r
* Patent Ductus Arteriosus - it is a neonatal condition wherein the ductus arteriosus (blood vessel that connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta) fails to close after birth causing severe risk of heart failure. The prostaglandin inhibition of ibuprofen has been studied for the treatment of this condition as it is known that prostaglandin E2 is responsible for keeping the ductus arteriosus open.[A39100]\r
\r
* Rheumatoid- and osteo-arthritis - ibuprofen is very commonly used in the symptomatic treatment of inflammatory, musculoskeletal and rheumatic disorders.[A39176]\r
\r
* Cystic fibrosis - the use of high dosages of ibuprofen has been proven to decrease inflammation and decreasing polymorphonuclear cell influx in the lungs.[A39177]\r
\r
* Orthostatic hypotension - ibuprofen can induce sodium retention and antagonize the effect of diuretics which has been reported to be beneficial for patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.[A1651]\r
\r
* Dental pain - ibuprofen is used to manage acute and chronic orofacial pain.[A10901]\r
\r
* Pain - ibuprofen is widely used to reduce minor aches and pains as well as to reduce fever and manage dysmenorrhea. It is very commonly used for the relief of acute indications such as fever and tension headaches.[A39092] It is also used to manage mild to moderate pain and moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics.[L40208]\r
\r
* Investigational uses - efforts have been put into developing ibuprofen for the prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, and breast cancer.[A39092]""" ;
    drugbank:mechanism_of_action """The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]\r
\r
Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]""" ;

    drugbank:toxicity """The symptoms of overdose are presented in individuals that consumed more than 99 mg/kg. Most common symptoms of overdose are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, vertigo, drowsiness (somnolence), dizziness and insomnia. Other symptoms of overdose include headache, loss of consciousness, tinnitus, CNS depression, convulsions and seizures. May rarely cause metabolic acidosis, abnormal hepatic function, hyperkalemia, renal failure, dyspnea, respiratory depression, coma, acute renal failure, and apnea (primarily in very young pediatric patients).[A39200]\r

Maximum serum ofloxacin concentrations after ten days of topical ophthalmic dosing were more than 1000 times lower than those reported after standard oral doses of ofloxacin. Tear ofloxacin concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 31 mcg/g during the 40 minute period following the last dose on day 11. Mean tear concentration measured four hours after topical ophthalmic dosing was 9.2 mcg/g. Corneal tissue concentrations of 4.4 mcg/mL were observed four hours after beginning topical ocular application of two drops of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution every 30 minutes. Ofloxacin was excreted in the urine primarily unmodified. Microbiology: Ofloxacin has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. Ofloxacin is thought to exert a bactericidal effect on susceptible bacterial cells by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential bacterial enzyme which is a critical catalyst in the duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no cross-resistance between ofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides. Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and clinically, in conjunctival and/or corneal ulcer infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). *Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections AEROBES, GRAM-POSITIVE: AEROBES, GRAM-NEGATIVE: ANAEROBIC SPECIES: Staphylococcus aureus Enterobacter cloacae Propionibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens* The safety and effectiveness of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution in treating ophthalmologic infections due to the following organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

    openfda:microbiology "Microbiology: Ofloxacin has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations. Ofloxacin is thought to exert a bactericidal effect on susceptible bacterial cells by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an essential bacterial enzyme which is a critical catalyst in the duplication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Cross-resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. There is generally no cross-resistance between ofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams or aminoglycosides. Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and clinically, in conjunctival and/or corneal ulcer infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). *Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections AEROBES, GRAM-POSITIVE: AEROBES, GRAM-NEGATIVE: ANAEROBIC SPECIES: Staphylococcus aureus Enterobacter cloacae Propionibacterium acnes Staphylococcus epidermidis Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens* The safety and effectiveness of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution in treating ophthalmologic infections due to the following organisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

    openfda:warnings "WARNINGS NOT FOR INJECTION. Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution should not be injected subconjunctivally, nor should it be introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. There are rare reports of anaphylactic reaction/shock and fatal hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving systemic quinolones, some following the first dose, including ofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. A rare occurrence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which progressed to toxic epidermal necrolysis, has been reported in a patient who was receiving topical ophthalmic ofloxacin. If an allergic reaction to ofloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management, including intubation should be administered as clinically indicated." .
